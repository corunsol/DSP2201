# Udacity - Intro to Machine Learning course

Modified and tuned by Marcus



## Notes

1. The original dataset from Udacity was prepared based on Python 2.x, which is not installed on our Anaconda 2021 system.
2. I have migrated all of the program from Python 2.x to Python 3.8, which is compatible to our Anaconda.
3. The original dataset is still uploaded in the name of "**udacity-intro-to-machine-learning-projects-master.zip**".
4. Please pull "**Udacity-Intro-to-Machine-Learning-dsp2105-solutions.zip**" down to your desktop to try out.
5. Once you unzip the file, it's gonna be around 154MB.



## Pre-requisites

Once you unzip all of the files to your local drive, you have to go to "tools" sub-folder to run "**startup.py**" to download the Enron dataset, which is 422MB to the parent folder of "tools". Be prepared some time for downloading.
